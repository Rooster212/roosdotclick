The next step for me getting started with Proxmox was to add a bit more storage. The bundled 256GB SSDs are great for the basics, but I'm mainly concerned with the longevity of them (considering they are already well used!) and generally the fact that it's not really that much space.

Amazon to the rescue with some 1TB NVMe drives on sale for Â£59 which is an absolute bargain. I had to go with NVMe drives as it was the only spare slot for storage available in the miniature nodes I picked up (covered in my [last article]({{< relref "0002_vlans_and_proxmox.md" >}})).

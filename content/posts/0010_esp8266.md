# Connecting up ESPHome, ESP8266 and an OLED screen.

Long term plan - show temperature and humidity on screen, add the ability to turn my fan on via IR, connect to Home Assistant.

Short term: get the thing working, being able to upload code, with a temperature display if I can!

Spoiler: I got it working with some trial and error!

## The device

The device I have was from an AliExpress listing. I thought the screen would be great for quick feedback, and I think that is definitely true here.

[I bought a few of these boards from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005242283189.html?gps-id=pcStoreJustForYou&scm=1007.23125.137358.0&scm_id=1007.23125.137358.0&scm-url=1007.23125.137358.0&pvid=cbce1b04-37e4-40b2-bb50-09b810a6e788&_t=gps-id:pcStoreJustForYou,scm-url:1007.23125.137358.0,pvid:cbce1b04-37e4-40b2-bb50-09b810a6e788,tpp_buckets:668%232846%238107%231934&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%214.27%214.27%21%21%214.27%214.27%21%40211b81b117169181668323219e4b24%2112000032335054938%21rec%21UK%21%21AB&spm=a2g0o.store_pc_home.smartJustForYou_2002720320865.1005005242283189). I have several others but this seemed like a great starting point.

## Difficulties and solving them!

1. Where the hell do I get the info about this random AliExpress board?
1. What are the pinouts, and how can I put stuff on screen?
1. How can I connect the temperature monitor and use it?


Well, long story short, I managed to [find the AliExpress listing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005242283189.html?gps-id=pcStoreJustForYou&scm=1007.23125.137358.0&scm_id=1007.23125.137358.0&scm-url=1007.23125.137358.0&pvid=cbce1b04-37e4-40b2-bb50-09b810a6e788&_t=gps-id:pcStoreJustForYou,scm-url:1007.23125.137358.0,pvid:cbce1b04-37e4-40b2-bb50-09b810a6e788,tpp_buckets:668%232846%238107%231934&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%214.27%214.27%21%21%214.27%214.27%21%40211b81b117169181668323219e4b24%2112000032335054938%21rec%21UK%21%21AB&spm=a2g0o.store_pc_home.smartJustForYou_2002720320865.1005005242283189). This contained a _lot_ of vital information:

| Spec         | Detail | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Memory (RAM) | 128KB  |       |
| Storage      | 4MB    |       |
| SRAM         | 64KB   |       |
| Clock speed  | 80MHz  |       |

And some really important pinout info (ESP8266 -> OLED), combined with ESP8266 info that I managed to glean:

| ESP8266 Pin | OLED Pin         | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| VCC (3.3v)  | VCC              |       |
| GND         | GND              |       |
| D6 (GPIO12) | Screen Clock     | In ESPHome, this is mapped to the `i2c` `sda` line |
| D5 (GPIO14) | Screen Data Line | In ESPHome, this is mapped to the `i2c` `scl` line |

I also managed to find some other valuable information:

- Don't connect anything external to D5. This makes the device not boot properly (probably because the screen is on that line)
- Don't connect anything permanently to D8. My device wouldn't boot when I connected it up. I believe from reading online that this is because D8 can be used to select SD Card on bootup on the ESP8266.

Other pinouts that I manage to find and document.

## My setup

I installed ESP Home through Home Assistant. I have my HA and my IoT networks on separate networks so I am using static IPs for now - I know there are ways to use mDNS to make discovery work properly, but I haven't worked it out yet in my router.

And here is my setup:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: test-esp8266-ideaspark
  friendly_name: test_esp8266_ideaspark

esp8266:
  board: esp01_1m

# Enable logging
logger:

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:
  encryption:
    key: fakekey

ota:
  password: fakepassword

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

  manual_ip:
    static_ip: 192.168.107.231
    gateway: 192.168.107.1
    subnet: 255.255.255.0

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: "Test-Esp8266-Ideaspark"
    password: fakepassword

captive_portal:

# Here are the important bits for a test
i2c:
  sda: GPIO12
  scl: GPIO14

font:
  - file: "gfonts://Ubuntu+Mono"
    id: ubuntu_font
    size: "16"

sensor:
  - platform: dht
    pin: GPIO5
    temperature:
      name: "Temperature"
      id: "temp"
    humidity:
      name: "Humidity"
      id: "humidity"
    update_interval: 60s

display:
  - platform: ssd1306_i2c
    model: "SSD1306 128x64"
    reset_pin: GPIO0
    address: 0x3C
    lambda: |-
      it.printf(0, 18, id(ubuntu_font), "%s", String(id(temp).state).c_str());
      it.printf(0, 40, id(ubuntu_font), "%s", String(id(humidity).state).c_str());
```

And here is how it looks in all it's glory:

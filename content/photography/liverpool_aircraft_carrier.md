When the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales was in Liverpool, whilst I didn't manage to get on board, it was an impressive ship to see. I took a few pictures when it was arriving and some more on the day it was leaving.

When it was first coming into dock, I got a few pictures but they are taken through the exceptionally dirty windows of the Liver Building, so excuse the quality...

On the day it was leaving I took some clearer ones closer up:

Using my phone's ultrawide camera to get some more of the scene in:

Using the zoom lens on my phone gave me some great detail on the bridge section:

This one was interesting - I took an ultra slow motion video - it's taken at 1920x1080 resolution but it's 240 frames per second.
